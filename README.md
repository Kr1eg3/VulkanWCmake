# VulkanWCmake

This is an unfinished project in which I, like everyone else who studies Vulkan, tried to encapsulate it in some way. This project uses CMake practices that I will definitely use in future projects and the project itself, or rather the mistakes I made, served as a basis for a new and better project.

Requires only a Vulkan. Other dependencies are loaded and linked using CMake.
